About this Book
===============

This book is authored and published as an Open Source book. It is written using the reStructuredText markup language and versioned using Git, currently on bitbucket and rendered through sphinx. Additions, corrections and contributions are welcome.

When this book reaches a more mature version, content will probably be moved to github to facilitate quick development and contrinutions by readers and users of this book.

This book will help you learn Linux System Administration using various distributions of Linux. The book will mostly focus on CentOS version 6, 7 and 8,(and thus, by extension also Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Oracle Linux, Scientific Linux, others), Debian version 8, 9 and 10 and Ubuntu LTS releases 16.04 and 18.04.

Where applicable, the book will explain the theory behind something, and also document the various methods to configure a specific feature using the commandline or configuration-files and/or various configuration-tools provided by the distribution. Where applicable, the more modern method of configuring things using Configuration Management tooling such as Ansible will also be highlighted.

The book will help you prepare for various certifications and exams like RHCSA or LPI-1 and LPI-2 or an equivalent level of System Administration knowledge usable on any Linux platform and environment.

Typography and Layout
---------------------

Where possible, commands that can be typed are formatted as **bold**

File and directory names will be presented as follows:

:file:`filename` or :file:`/directory/path/` 

In code-samples and screen views, code-blocks are used, with lines where commands were given highlighted:

.. code-block:: none
  :emphasize-lines: 1,3

  $ some-command-here
  it's output
  $ another command here
  more output
  and more

In longer examples, or where further text will refer to line-numbers, these can be found
in the left margin.

Environment variables are presented as :envvar:`ENV-VAR`
