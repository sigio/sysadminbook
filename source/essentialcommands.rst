Essential Shell Commands
========================

In the following chapters of this book we will run into very many different commands, and it's not possible to explain all commands before then appear in some examples or are needed for some tasks we will run into. This chapter will describe some of the most-often used commands and occasionally give example output.

.. index:: cd, pwd

We will start with some commands that are used to navigate the filesystem and inspect files:

======= =========================== ======================
Command Function                    Safe Example
======= =========================== ======================
cd      Change directory            cd /usr/local/bin
pwd     Show current directory      pwd
cat     Show contents of a file     cat /etc/passwd
less    Page though a file          less /etc/services
ls      Show directory listing      ls -alF /
======= =========================== ======================

cd and pwd
----------

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,3,4,6,20,21

  $ pwd
  /home/yourname
  $ cd /usr/local
  $ pwd
  /usr/local
  $ ls -al
  total 0
  drwxr-xr-x. 12 root root 131 Nov 23 18:31 .
  drwxr-xr-x. 13 root root 155 Nov 23 18:31 ..
  drwxr-xr-x.  2 root root   6 Apr 11  2018 bin
  drwxr-xr-x.  2 root root   6 Apr 11  2018 etc
  drwxr-xr-x.  2 root root   6 Apr 11  2018 games
  drwxr-xr-x.  2 root root   6 Apr 11  2018 include
  drwxr-xr-x.  2 root root   6 Apr 11  2018 lib
  drwxr-xr-x.  2 root root   6 Apr 11  2018 lib64
  drwxr-xr-x.  2 root root   6 Apr 11  2018 libexec
  drwxr-xr-x.  2 root root   6 Apr 11  2018 sbin
  drwxr-xr-x.  5 root root  49 Nov 23 18:31 share
  drwxr-xr-x.  2 root root   6 Apr 11  2018 src
  $ cd
  $ pwd
  /home/yourname

As can be seen in the example above, the **pwd** command will print the directory we are currently in back to the shell, and the **cd** command can be used to change to a different directory. If you run the **cd** command with an argument, you change to the specified directory, when running **cd** without any arguments, it will bring you to your *HOME* directory. The *HOME* directory is the directory you enter when you login to a system and where you can write your own files.

To navigate to various directories you can either specify a complete and absolute path, or use relative paths. An absulute path is a path that starts with a **/** character, denoting the *root* of the filesystem. In the example above, **/usr/local** is an absolute path. In the example below we will use relative paths:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,3,4,6,7,8,10,11

  $ pwd
  /home/yourname
  $ cd ..
  $ pwd
  /home
  $ cd /usr/local/lib
  $ cd ../bin
  $ pwd
  /usr/local/bin
  $ cd ~
  $ pwd
  /home/yourname

By using *..*, you indicate that you want to go up one level in the directory-tree, combining this with other directory names you can navigate back down other branches of the tree. If you are not to familiar with this method of navigating the filesystem you can always use absolute paths as an alternative method of navigating, but this will usually require some more typing.

.. index:: cat, less

cat and less
------------

The **cat** command (which is short for concatinate), can be used to concatinate files, but it's mostly used to get the contents of a file printed back to your terminal. If you specify multiple files as arguments to the **cat** command, all files will be printed to the terminal one after the other, as if they were 1 continuous file (as such, they have been concatinated before being sent to your terminal).

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,3,12

  $ cat /etc/redhat-release
  CentOS Linux release 7.5.1804 (Core) 
  $ cat /etc/shells 
  /bin/sh
  /bin/bash
  /sbin/nologin
  /usr/bin/sh
  /usr/bin/bash
  /usr/sbin/nologin
  /bin/tcsh
  /bin/csh
  $ cat /etc/redhat-release /etc/shells 
  CentOS Linux release 7.5.1804 (Core) 
  /bin/sh
  /bin/bash
  /sbin/nologin
  /usr/bin/sh
  /usr/bin/bash
  /usr/sbin/nologin
  /bin/tcsh
  /bin/csh

If you **cat** a larger file, or multiple files at the same time, the contents of these files will fly over your screen quickly. If you want to actually have the possibility of reading the contents, it's better to use what's called a *pager*. Linux comes with multiple alternative pagers, classical UNIX systems had the *more* pager, which you can also find on most Linux systems. However there is usually also a pager called **less**. The *less* pager will print the contents of the
file one screen-full at a time and will either scroll a single line, or a full screenlength up or down through the file when you press one of the arrow-keys, page-up or page-down or the space key. If you want to exit less, you can press the **q** to exit back to your shell. Another handy feature of *less* is that it can be used to search for text though a file, when entering **/sometext** it will scroll to the next occurance of *sometext* and highlight the text in the file.

.. index:: ls

ls
--

The **ls** command is used to get information about files and directories, compare it with the **DIR** command in for example DOS and Windows systems. If you just run **ls** it will show a short listing of all files and directories in the current working directory. Specifying various arguments to the *ls* command will alter the way this information is presented. The most used options to *ls* are:

-a          Show hidden files and directories (names starting with a dot)
-l          Show a long listing, one name per line, with permission, size and date information
-F          Classify names as either directory, regular file or executable


File manipulation commands
--------------------------

Next up are some file-manipulation commands:

.. index:: cp, mv, rm, mkdir, rmdir

======= =========================== ===============================
Command Function                    Safe Example
======= =========================== ===============================
cp      Copy a file                 cp /etc/passwd ~
mv      Move or rename files        mv ~/passwd ~/renamed
rm      Remove a file               rm ~/renamed
mkdir   Create a directory          mkdir /tmp/myfiles
rmdir   Remove (empty) directories  rmdir /tmp/myfiles
======= =========================== ===============================

These basic file manipulation commands will let you copy, erase and move-around files or create and remove directories. The **cp** and **mv** commands need at least two arguments, a source and a target to work on. If you specify more then 2 arguments, and the last argument is a directory, all other arguments are considered as source, and multiple files will be copied or moved to the specified target directory.

.. sidebar:: rmdir vs rm -r

  As stated, the **rmdir** command will only remove empty directories. If you want to remove a directory, and all files and other directories within this directory, you can use the **rm -r** command. But be careful, if used carelessly, it can delete large amounts of files before you notice any possible mistake. If using **rm -r** and not feeling comfortable, add the **-i** option, which asks for confirmation before deleting files and directories.

  Example: **rm -i -r /tmp/mydirectory**

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,3,4,6,20,21

  $ mkdir /tmp/mydirectory
  $ ls -la /tmp/mydirectory/
  total 0
  drwxrwxr-x.  2 yourname yourname   6 Nov 24 03:21 .
  drwxrwxrwt. 10 root     root     253 Nov 24 03:21 ..
  $ cp /etc/issue /etc/issue.net /etc/passwd /tmp/mydirectory
  $ ls -la /tmp/mydirectory/
  total 12
  drwxrwxr-x.  2 yourname yourname   50 Nov 24 03:21 .
  drwxrwxrwt. 10 root     root      253 Nov 24 03:21 ..
  -rw-r--r--.  1 yourname yourname   23 Nov 24 03:21 issue
  -rw-r--r--.  1 yourname yourname   22 Nov 24 03:21 issue.net
  -rw-r--r--.  1 yourname yourname 2205 Nov 24 03:21 passwd
  $ cd /tmp/mydirectory
  $ rm issue issue.net
  $ ls -la
  total 4
  drwxrwxr-x.  2 yourname yourname   20 Nov 24 03:22 .
  drwxrwxrwt. 10 root     root      253 Nov 24 03:21 ..
  -rw-r--r--.  1 yourname yourname 2205 Nov 24 03:21 passwd
  $ rm /tmp/mydirectory/passwd
  $ rmdir /tmp/mydirectory


Editing files
-------------

.. sidebar:: Never use word-processors on textfiles

  If you have a GUI installed, you may be tempted to open textfiles with a wordprocessor like LibreOffice, OpenOffice or something along those lines. While this may be fine, if not a bit overkill, to read files, never use a tool like this for editing plain-text files, as these tools will often make subtle changes in the contents of the files which will have significant impact when these are used as configuration files. Always use a dedicated plain-text only editor like vim or mcedit

Another important and often performed task of any System Administrator is editing textfiles. Unix en Linux systems are filled with many plain-text files, and they are used as configuration files for almost all services and programs installed on Linux systems. On most Linux systems you will find a number of different editors and each has their own strenghts and weaknesses. The popular choices amoung experienced Linux System Administrators are vi/vim and Emacs, however, both of these
text-editors have quite the learning-curve. New Linux users and System Administrators are probably better off starting with a simpler editor like nano, joe, jed, or mcedit when working on remote hosts or on the console. When working with a GUI, there are some more choices which work and look like regular text-editors as used on Windows for example.

There will be a chapter on working with VI and VIM later, as VI is considered the 'standard' editor, and will almost always be present on any Linux or UNIX system and has some really powerful features. For now, we will let you use any editor of your choice, and just give you some pointers to start with here. These more user-friendly editors are usually not installed by default on a fresh Linux system, so we will also list the commands used to install them here.

=========== ==========================  ========================
Editor      Install on CentOS/RHEL      Install on Debian/Ubuntu
=========== ==========================  ========================
vim         # yum install vim-enhanced  # apt install vim
nano        # yum install nano          # apt install nano
mcedit      # yum install mc            # apt install mc
=========== ==========================  ========================

Finding help
------------

If this book were to describe any and all commands available on an average Linux system,
we would be here a while and this would not be a good investment of your and my time.
Luckily your Linux system comes with a lot of documentation and methods for getting
information about what various commands do, how they work, and how you use them. So it's
much better to just tell you how and where to find this information.

.. index:: man

man
^^^

The first command that can tell you a lot about other available commands that you should
know about it the **man** command. It is a browser for the *manual pages*. Many commands
installed on Linux come with manual pages. You can start by looking at the man-pages of
varuous commands we used before, or the manual-page of the **man** command itself:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,2,3,4

  $ man man
  $ man cat
  $ man bash
  $ man mv cp ls rm

When running the **man** command with (one or more) arguments, it will look for the
manual-page for the specified argument and display this page in a pager. You can scroll up
and down with the arrow-keys or space, page-up and page-down. If you want to go back to
your shell, press *q*. In the last command above, multiple manual pages will be opened,
one after the other, and pressing *q* will move you to the next one until all pages have
been seen

Manpages will usually contain all the information you will need, describing all the
options and arguments a command will accept, how it does what it does, which files it
might use or read from, what environment-settings may influence its task, and what
error-codes it might return. It usually also has a section called 'SEE ALSO' with other
manual-pages you could take a look at for related commands.

.. index:: info, pinfo

info / pinfo
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some tools do not have manual-pages, or only have very limited manual-pages, which direct
you to check out a section in the **info** tool. Using the **info** or **pinfo** command,
you can read documentation written in the *info* system. This system is somewhat more like
webpages, with a hypertext like structure with links between various sections.

The info pages are mostly used by GNU tools, while manual-pages are used by most other
software.

.. index:: --help

command help
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most commands in linux will also have a built-in help option. This will usually give you a
short (a few lines, upto maybe a screenfull) summary of the options and usage methods of
the command. Some commands will show this information if given the **--help** argument,
others only respond to **-h** or some other option. Often a text telling you how to get to
this help-text will be printed when you used the command with invalid options.

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,2,3,4

  $ cp --help
  Usage: cp [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST
    or:  cp [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY
    or:  cp [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...
  Copy SOURCE to DEST, or multiple SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.
  
  Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  ...(snipped another 70 lines of output)...

/usr/share/doc
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Another location where you may find documentation on commands is in the /usr/share/doc
directory on your filesystem. Here you will usually find things like example configuration
files and sometimes complete user-manuals for more advanced software packages.
