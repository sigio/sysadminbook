Installing Debian 9
===================

To install Debian 9.x, we will need a system with the following resources:

* 64-bit CPU
* 1 GB of RAM
* 4 GB of diskspace
* Optical drive
* Ethernet network

The debian installer is very flexibel and has many options, and using the installer it's
possible to install Debian on a wide variety of systems, from very resource-constrained
embedded platforms to huge servers. You can have a reasonably useful debian system running
on 1 GB of ram and 2 GB of diskspace, but if you want to run a graphical environment you
will need some more diskspace.
